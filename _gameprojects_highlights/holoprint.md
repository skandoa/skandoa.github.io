<h1> Holoprint 3D </h1>

<h2> Context </h2>
For my first year of Master's Degree, my Tutored Project was about creating an app on the Hololens 2, a mixed reality device by Microsoft. The app had to provide the user with a simple, but concrete and usable skill.

The App
The app is about learning how to use a Ultimaker 3 3D Printer. The steps include :

- Changing / Replacing / Removing the ink
- Navigating through the interface
- Printing an item thanks to an USB drive

Additional functions will be added as we exit the prototype phase.
