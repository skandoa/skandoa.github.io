        My name is Skander Alexandre Giovanni Aghilone, I'm 26 and people keep asking me: Why do you have a blue/green dot on your forehead?
    </br></br>
        I have no idea, got it since I was born.
    </br></br>
        If I had to define myself in three words: Creativity, Passion, and Teamwork.
    </br></br>
        I'm an artist, most of my hobbies are related to art and it's been like that since I was a small chaotic child. Designing and playing games is a huge part of my life as well.
    </br></br>
        I also have a background in programming, with two diplomas and a soft spot for Python.
    </br></br>
        I have an alter-ego whose name is Saga and they perform on stage regularly. It's been my main artistic outlet for 3 years now.
