<h2>Context and role</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
I got hired for an internship as a full time Level builder and designer at Eugen Systems. 
I worked on WARNO's maps that got released after Early Access. 
</br></br>
My work spanned throughout all stages of map production, from shaping the forests and roads, to creating new structures. 
I have extensively worked with 3D creation and designing tools.

<h2>The Game</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
"Realistic, immersive, breathtaking. WARNO is the ultimate World War III battle simulator from the masters of strategy, Eugen Systems. 
A Cold War turns decisively hot as you command hundreds of units on a beautiful and brutal battlefield. 
Outsmart, outfight, and lead your forces to total victory."
</br></br>
Deploy into an authentic, expansive, and meticulously researched Cold War real-time strategy game with WARNO. 
As the spiritual successor to the acclaimed Wargame series, WARNO is the ultimate next-gen World War III battle simulator. 
</br></br>
Two years have passed since Gorbachev's overthrow in a coup by hardline communists, and now, in the dark summer days of 1989, the Cold War finally turns hot. 
The armies of NATO and Warsaw Pact have deployed in a divided and tense Germany. Conflict is imminent. The only thing left is to wait for the inevitable Warning Order that will begin it all. War is coming home, commandersâ€¦
</br></br>
WARNO - Warning Order - lets you command your customized battlegroup and lead hundreds of Cold War-era units to victory on dynamic, tactical battlefields. 
Choose between the arsenals of NATO or the Warsaw Pact, and fight across a multitude of solo and online modes against challenging AI or human opponents in massive 10v10 battles. 
Show your mettle as a strategic commander in the turn-based Army General campaigns depicting a devastating, techno-thrilling World War III in Western Europe.
