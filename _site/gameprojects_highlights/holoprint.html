<h1> Holoprint 3D </h1>

<h2> Context </h2>
<p>For my first year of Masterâ€™s Degree, my Tutored Project was about creating an app on the Hololens 2, a mixed reality device by Microsoft. The app had to provide the user with a simple, but concrete and usable skill.</p>

<p>The App
The app is about learning how to use a Ultimaker 3 3D Printer. The steps include :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changing / Replacing / Removing the ink</li>
  <li>Navigating through the interface</li>
  <li>Printing an item thanks to an USB drive</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional functions will be added as we exit the prototype phase.</p>
